TODO:
- By default it should not allow adding and removing until the user accepts a warning
  That their files will be modified
- The editor command needs to be persistant and not changing every time we do init
- Change classes that are not instantiated into modules
- Move all logic out of the Frog::Main class which should act as only interface
