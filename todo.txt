TODO:
- Move all logic out of the Frog::Main class which should act as interface only
- The editor command needs to be persistent and not changing every time we do init. 
  In general there is need for a better configuration workflow.
- Change classes that are not instantiated into modules
- Log completed task into a file with project task keys so that we can retrieve our
  progress through time and undo completed item
- method for creation of new todo files with the right formatting.
- better indentation when listing items
