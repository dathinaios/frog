TODO:
- The editor command needs to be persistant and not changing every time we do init
- Change classes that are not instantiated into modules
- Move all logic out of the Frog::Main class which should act as only interface
- Log completed task into a file with project task keys so that we can retrieve our
  progress through time and undo completed item
