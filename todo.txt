TODO:
- Add tests for public methods
- Change scand_and_inform to need an explicit directory and change the defaults to use tilde
- Add method to refresh for new or deleted files or make init more clever. At the moment if I call init again I lose my editor command.
- Create an alias for edit to e as it clashes with the far less used editor
- Have frog random [PROJECT] return a random todo if it is not initialised
- Overview command frog world [PROJECT]
- Log completed task into a file with project task keys so that we can retrieve our progress through time and undo completed item
- Method for creation of new todo files with the right formatting.
- Better indentation when listing items
- Change read_config_files method to paths
- Make sure that the command return correct exit codes and that do not result in errors
  when the process is interupted
- Change classes that are not instantiated into modules
- In choose state the project method returns the paths. I should be able to get the
  paths without printing and vise versa
- Instead of just todo the utility accepts any yaml key but just ignores it. when
  there is a key note it could actually use it in the list command. or maybe the list
  command could get anything and then it is up to the user to define what he is looking
  for. although i think "frog note" is a good command to have
- Have an idea field and then an option to call an idea at random and then choose
  to pass it in a todo or delete it
